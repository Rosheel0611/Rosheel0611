Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?

Yes you can clearly track the development of the website through the commits because with the commits you can clearly see and view all the changes and progress is being recorded for the websites. 

How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?

So as of right now the commit messages communicate relatively okay as to what I am doing but I believe that I can make it more specific.

How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?

I can utlize this procress with regular day to day life by helping me organize some daily tasks or even just to keep track of day to day things.
